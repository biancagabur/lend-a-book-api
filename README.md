# # lend-a-book-api
Flask based API
The idea behind this API was to learn Flask and how it works, and also to improve my python knowledge. 

In order to run this application you can use the requiremnts.txt file using the following commad:  

```bash
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In order to create the add the following line **db.create_all()** like below and run the api.
```bash
  if __name__ == '__main__':
    db.create_all()
    app.run()
```
